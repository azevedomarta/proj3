  <p class="text">This project aims to understand the way we consume information online and the way it is presented to us, revealing the role of personalization algorithms in this process. </p>

  <div id="column_2">
    
    <p class="text" id="text_2">By sharing an incredible amount of personal information online, in the name of freedom of choice and freedom of expression, individuals become vulnerable <b>psychopolitical control</b> and <b>behavioural forecasting</b>. Excess consumption leaves them restless for more information, but they lack the <b>power of judgment</b> to process and understand it all correctly. The concept of "reality" is inevitably affected and becomes blurred, given the biased way in which information is filtered and targeted.
      <br> <br>  
    The project addresses this issue from 4 points of view: <b class="question">Who wins?</b> The goal is to consider those who <b>abuse and control our data</b>, addressing the role of states, institutions, and corporations; <b class="question">Who loses?</b> The focus is how artificial intelligence uses our information to perfect its systems, turning us into the <b>new generation of lab rats</b>; <b class="question">Who pays?</b> The intention is to expose who more seriously suffers the consequences, addressing forms of <b>digital colonialism and exoticization</b> enabled by algorithms that are intrinsically racist, xenophobic, sexist and elitist; <b class="question">Whatâ€™s next?</b> Finally, tackling what are the predictable <b> effects of these developments on our way of being and communicating, or perceiving reality.</b></p></div>
